# freehand-drawing-tool
This freehand drawing tool is my first attempt at creatign an app using object-oriented programming.
The app was built to offer the user 3 brush sizes and 6 colors.
It also features a button for clearing the canvas and a button for saving then drawing to png.

The core of this app is based on the HTML Canvas element.
